# Introduction

Creidhne is a bash script used to create the base directory structure and files that I like to use for NodeJS projects.

It's not designed to be a tool to suit everyones needs, but it's useful when starting a new project.

[Creidhne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creidhne) was the goldsmith of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.
